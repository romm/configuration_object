/**
 * A service event is an interface which can be implemented by any service.
 *
 * The service must then implement the interface functions, which will
 * automatically be detected and used during the configuration object creation
 * process.
 *
 * All service events functions have a single parameter: an instance of a
 * `AbstractServiceDTO` object, which you can interact with.
 *
 * This interface must be inherited by any service event which can be included
 * in the `ServiceFactory`.
